# Project 4: Basic Chat Server

## Software Requirements

### Basic Functionality:
- Users can connect to the server via a command-line client.
- Users can send messages to a common chatroom where all connected users can see the messages.
- The server should broadcast incoming messages to all connected clients.
- Users should be able to disconnect from the server cleanly.

### Advanced Features (Optional):
- Implement private messaging between users.
- Allow users to join different chatrooms or create their own.
- Add basic user authentication for joining the chat (username/password).
- Provide command-line options for configuring the server (e.g., port number).

### User Interface:
- The client should provide a simple command-line interface for sending and receiving messages.
- Display a list of connected users and chatrooms (if implemented).

### Error Handling:
- Handle connection errors gracefully, both on the server and client sides.
- Ensure that user messages are correctly delivered or inform users if there was an issue.

### Code Structure:
- The code should be organized into modules separating concerns (e.g., networking, message handling, user management).
- Utilize concurrency for handling multiple clients simultaneously.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- **Core Features:**
  - Multiple users should be able to connect to the server and communicate in real-time.
  - Messages should be broadcasted correctly and received by all users.

- **Advanced Features (if implemented):**
  - Private messaging should work without interfering with public chat.
  - Chatrooms should be functional and isolated from one another.

- **User Interface:**
  - The command-line interface should be clear and responsive.
  - Connected users and chatrooms (if implemented) should be displayed correctly.

- **Error Handling:**
  - The server should handle user disconnections and connection errors smoothly.
  - Users should receive appropriate feedback if their message fails to send.

- **Code Quality:**
  - The code should be clean, modular, and well-documented.
  - Haskell best practices, especially concerning concurrency, should be followed.
